# Telecommunication Systems III - Project
This assignment was part of the course Telecommunication Systems III (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 7th semester).

The purpose of this work is to study digital communication through a limited bandwidth, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, and to simulate a telecommunication system with zero and controlled intersymbol interference (ISI) through MATLAB.

The performance of a telecommunication system was studied in the following cases:
1. The transmitter and receiver filters are selected so that we have zero ISI on the receiver.
2. The transmitter and receiver filters are selected so that we have controlled ISI on the receiver. A duobinary pulse, precoding in the transmitter, and symbol-to-symbol detection are used.
3. The transmitter and receiver filters are selected so that we have controlled ISI on the receiver. A duobinary pulse and the Viterbi algorithm are used.
